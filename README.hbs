# sanitize-dom

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/michaelfranzl/sanitize-dom.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/michaelfranzl/sanitize-dom)

Recursive sanitizer/filter for [WHATWG DOM](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org)s. Flexible use cases with convenient configuration options. More complex filtering can be implemented via filters (callback functions).

This project is similar to [sanitize-html](https://github.com/punkave/sanitize-html) but works with a bare-metal DOM API rather than with HTML strings. Because it leverages the browser's own HTML parsing, it has no dependencies and a very small footprint (only 7 kilobytes). It is not limited to browsers when using a WHATWG DOM implementation like [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom).

The [test file](tests/test.js) describes usage and features.

Run tests:

    npm test
